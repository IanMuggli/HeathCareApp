# HeathCareApp

healthcareapp.zip contains a eclips project with the front end for a web app. As far as I know, it's written entierly in html and css, so you should be able to copy paste the files from the .jsp files into normal HTML files. To get to all of the content Alex and I created, go through the path '\healthcareapp.zip\healthcareapp\WebContent'.
